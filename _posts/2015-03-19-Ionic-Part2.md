We had two new members this week, and we spent the first half of the meeting getting everyone up speed with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and the various tools need to develop the [Chat application](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/ionic-intro). While the new members were getting settle, some of us tried out the new [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) application and got the application to "install" on iPhones, Android phones and even an iPad.  Ionic View allows you to "install" your ionic apps on your phone with out going through any of the app stores.

We ended up staying a couple minutes late but by the end of the meeting we all had Chat applications that were communicating in real time with each other!  We used [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to handle the real time syncing and it worked well for our purposes.

You can find the source for the demo and the solutions to the problems on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/ionic-intro).  See you in April!
