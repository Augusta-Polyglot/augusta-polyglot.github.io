After 2 years of polyglot fun, the Augusta Polyglot is taking a break.<br>
Justin and I have found ourselves in a very busy season and are unable to commit the time needed for a quality meetup. <br>
We would like to thank all of the people that have joined us to teach and learn and hope to see you all sometime in the future. <br>
<br>
Thanks,
Floyd
