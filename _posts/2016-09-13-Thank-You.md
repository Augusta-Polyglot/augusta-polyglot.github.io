After 2 years of polyglot fun, the Augusta Polyglot is taking a break.<br>
Justin and I have come to the realization that we have too many competing priorities and can not give the meetup the time it deserves.
<br>
We will not be scheduling any meetups for the immediate future. If anyone has any interest in taking over the meetings please let us know.
<br>
We would like to thank everyone who took the time to join us and hope to see you all sometime in the future.
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Floyd & Justin
