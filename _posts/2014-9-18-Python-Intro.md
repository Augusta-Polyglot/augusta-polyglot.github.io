At this meeting we learned the basics of [Python](https://www.python.org/) by walking through a script that was designed to parse [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) server logs.  Our resident security expert got the log files from his [honeypot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))  server  he has set up.  A Honeypot server is a decoy server used to detect malicious attacks. The various attacks on the honeypot server are then analyzed to prevent attacks before they hit the live servers. 

We had success learning the basics of Python (we even had some members write their first lines of code!) and the group decided that we should do a more in depth Log parsing example with Python next meeting.  You can find the sample files we used at our [Github page](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/Python-intro).
