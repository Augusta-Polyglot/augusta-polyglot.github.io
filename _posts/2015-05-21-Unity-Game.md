This month we had a great time learning about the [Unity Game Engine](http://unity3d.com/).

Justin Basinger lead the group through creating a [Space Invaders clone](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/unity-intro) called Galaxy Intruders!

The group got as far as moving the player around on the screen. Next months meeting will pick up where this one left of and hopefully we will be defending our bases by the end.

The code for the tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/unity-intro).

If you are planning to come to the next meeting, please [download and install](http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?ref=personal) Unity beforehand, as the Unity install is rather large and takes a while to download.

In other news we are currently looking for a larger space in the Augusta area. If you know of a space that can host approximately 30 people and has wifi, please let us know.

In other, other news, Microsoft MVP [Bill Wagner](http://thebillwagner.com/) may be joining us for a meeting in the next few months, so be on the look out for more information.
