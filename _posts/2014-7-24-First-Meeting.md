For our first meeting we had a good turn out.  We discuss goals for coming to the group and why we started the group.  We had all skill levels from beginner to professional developers.  Everyone was welcoming helpful.  We even learned the origins of [hello world programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program).

Our first meeting was an introduction to [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).  No-one in the group had much experience with functional programming but we went for it anyways.  We spent the meeting following the [introduction](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html) to installing, configuring our environment and finally playing with Elixir in it's [interactive shell](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html#1.6-interactive-mode). Everyone had a blast and we decided to do it again next month!
