Have you ever spent hours or even days trying to set up a development environment?  It can be painful to make sure everything is installed, plays nice together, and on your [path](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).

This month we learned how to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) so we only have to go through that pain once (or even better, have some one else go through the pain for us).  Using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) we set up a repeatable environment that starts up a virtual machine with python installed with one command:```vagrant up```.  You can check out the code sample at [https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/vagrant-intro](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/vagrant-intro).

We will be using Vagrant for all our future meetings so that we don't *all* have to go through the process of setting up complex environments. Instead we will only have to make a quick call to ```vagrant up``` and we will be off coding!  (Don't worry knowing Vagrant won't be a requirement).  

At our next meeting will be learning [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) to build a mobile phone app.  A [Vagrantfile](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/) will be provided so we don't have to worry about Ionic's complex setup and dependencies.  See you there and Happy Holidays!
