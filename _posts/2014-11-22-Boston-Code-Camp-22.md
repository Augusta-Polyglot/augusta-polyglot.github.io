This past Saturday was [Boston Code Camp](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/) 22 and a we had a great turn out from our group at the Code Camp.  We manage to send  several car fulls to Boston for the day.

There were a lot of great [talks](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC22/Schedule/Index) and great people at the Conference.  Thanks to the [organizers](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC22/Volunteers/Index) and [sponsors](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC22/Sponsors) for putting it on!
