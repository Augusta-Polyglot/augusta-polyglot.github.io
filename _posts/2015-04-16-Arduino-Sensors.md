We had a record breaking turn out this month!  We have over 20 people show up to learn about [Ardunio's](http://www.arduino.cc/) and Sensors.  

We had a marine biologist from the [Darling Marine Center at University of Maine](http://dmc.umaine.edu/) give us an introduction to how sensors are used in her research.  Then her son gave us an introduction to [Ardunio](http://www.arduino.cc/) and some of the projects he has worked on (including a [Simon Says Arduino project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Simon-Says/)).  Next we had a breakout session for the rest of the night were groups build everything from a few blinking lights, LED Displays, and a ultrasonic music player.

(more pictures coming soon...)

We also had some members from the [Gardiner Maine Robotics team Iron Tigers](https://www.facebook.com/FIRST.Team.4041).  They brought their [cRio](http://www.ni.com/compactrio/) test platform they used to get prep for [FIRST Robotics](http://mainefirst.org/) competitions.  

It was fun night and thanks to everyone who came out!
