This month we had our second meeting learning about the [Unity Game Engine](http://unity3d.com/).

Justin Basinger lead the group through creating a [Space Invaders clone](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/unity-intro) called Galaxy Intruders!

We finished getting the space ship to fire bullets toward the stars!

The code for the tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/unity-intro).

Next month Jeff Chaplin will helping us learn about 3D modeling using blender.
If you are coming to the meeting please install Blender 2.75 from [here](http://www.blender.org/download/)

In other news we are currently looking for a larger space in the Augusta area. If you know of a space that can host approximately 30 people and has wifi, please let us know.
