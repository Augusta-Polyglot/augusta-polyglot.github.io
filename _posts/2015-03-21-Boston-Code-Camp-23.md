We had another great turn out for the [23 Boston Code Camp](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/)!  We even had two members of the group give talks.  [Floyd Hilton](http://floydhilton.com/) packed a room for his talk on [Getting your SQL into Version Control](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/Sessions/Details/14225) and it was standing room only.  [James Sturtevant](http://jamessturtevant.com) gave a talk on [Roslyn Diagnostic Analyzers](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/Sessions/Details/13215).  It was great time had by all.

There were a lot of other great [talks](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/Schedule/Index) and great people at the Conference.  Thanks to the [organizers](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/Volunteers/Index) and [sponsors](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC23/Sponsors) for putting it on!
