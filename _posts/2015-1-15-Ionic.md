We covered a lot of ground in our meeting this month.  We learned how HTML, CSS, and Javascript all come together in [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).  We also touched on how Ionic uses the Javascript framework [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and even learned a little bit of  [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern that angular encourages.  Finally, we learn first hand why mobile development is not for the faint of heart even if we have Ionic to help us along.  

Due to overwhelming excitement, we will be continuing our adventures into Ionic and mobile next month.  Be sure to check out our [GitHub Ionic repository](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/ionic-intro) to get the latest files.

We also picked up [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) as a sponsor this month and raffled off a free e-book!  We will have another e-book to raffle off next month so see you there!
