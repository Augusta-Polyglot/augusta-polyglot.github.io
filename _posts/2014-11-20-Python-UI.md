We had another good turn out at the meeting in November with quite a few new faces.  One of the new faces was a seventh grader and he brought a lot of enthusiasm for learning Python.  

We finished up our Python Classes with an intro to the [Tkinter](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/listbox.htm) UI [framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework).  Using the tkinter framework we added a simple UI on top of our log parsing applications we built in [previous meetings](http://augusta-polyglot.github.io/meeting/2014/10/16/Python-Log-Challenges.html).  

You can find the challenges and some of the solutions at [https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/Python-intro.](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/Python-intro/tree/master/UI)
