We have come a long way since one of the second meeting sitting on the floor of Barns & Noble with spotty internet.  At this meeting the group graduated to our own space with solid internet connection and a large conference table!

This week we used the Python skills we learned last week and worked through some challenges that started simple and got, well,  more challenging.  The end goal was to parse the server log files and find out where the attacks where coming from.  We all had a blast breaking into small groups and trying our hand at the problems.  

You can find the challenges and some of the solutions at [https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/Python-intro.](https://github.com/Augusta-Polyglot/Python-intro)
