At our second meeting we doubled our attendance!  The enthusiasm from the group was great.  We got some good feedback on our hands on approach to the meetings. And this week everyone walked away having created a website that was hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

We started out the meeting with some tech talk then moved right into learning a bit about [git](http://git-scm.com/).  Only a few minutes after a quick introduction to distributed source control everyone had a clone of their first Github pages repository.  We learned to use git command line and the GUI [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  By the end of the meeting everyone had their own site hosted on Github.  We even had someone attempt to make a site on their phone... unfortunately Github doesn't support editing sites one the phone as of now.  It was a fun exercise regardless.
